Course Information 
This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, focusing classic topics including supervised learning (discriminative/generative learning, neural networks, support vector machines); unsupervised learning (clustering, dimension reduction); ensemble learning (bagging, boosting); and fundamental issues in applying machine learning (model selection, evaluation). Lectures will discuss general issues in these topics and well-established algorithms, both from a computational aspect (how to compute the answer) and a statistical aspect (how to ensure that future predictions are accurate).

Note this class does not cover deep learning.
